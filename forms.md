# Forms and Events

### Forms 
Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred
to a printed document that contains
spaces for you to fill in information.
HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different
elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to
your site


There are several types of form controls that
you can use to collect information from visitors
to your site.

- Password input

Like a single line text box but it
masks the characters entered.
Text input (single-line)
Used for a single line of text such
as email addresses and names.
Text area (multi-line)
For longer areas of text, such as
messages and comments.

- Checkboxes -When a user can select and
unselect one or more options.

- Radio buttons-For use when a user must select
one of a number of options.

- Drop-down boxes-When a user must pick one of a
number of options from a list.

- Image buttons - Similar to submit buttons but
they allow you to use an image.

- Submit buttons -To submit data from your form
to another web page.

- File upload-Allows users to upload files
(e.g. images) to a website.


### LISTS ,TABLES AND FORMS

In addition to the CSS properties covered in other
chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

List markers can be given different appearances
using the list style type and list style image properties.

Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.

### Events

When you browse the web, your browser registers different
types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this
just happened." Your script can then respond to these events.
