# HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions

   ### TABLES
-	The <   table   > element is used to add tables to a web
page.

-	A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the <  tr  > element.

-	Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the <  td  > element (or <  th  > if it is a
header).
-	You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
XX For long tables you can split the table into a <  thead  >,
<  tbody  >, and <  tfoot  >.

  
### JS Constructor Functions

The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects.
Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers
to one object, usually the object in which the function operates

In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs.
To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of
related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.

If you want to access items via a property name or key, use an object
(but note that each key in the object must be unique).
If the order of the items is important, use an array.

The topmost object in the Document Object Model (or DOM) is the
document object. It represents the web page loaded into the current
browser window or tab. You meet its child objects in Chapter 5.
