# Images; CSS Color & Text

A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.
Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed. Here are three
examples of image placement that produce different results:

- before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.

- inside the start of a
paragraph
The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.

- in the middle of a paragraph The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.

***Color can really bring your pages to life.***
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:

- rgb values
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)

- hex codes
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80

- color names
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:

●●Those that directly affect the font and its appearance
(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)

●● Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)
