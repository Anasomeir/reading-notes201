# HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow


### HTML provides us with three different types:

●● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

●● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).

●● Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

CSS The visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users but It leaves a space where the element would have been. This property can take two values:
hidden
This hides the element.
visible
This shows the element.

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).


A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect, it tries to make sense of the operation rather than report an error.
