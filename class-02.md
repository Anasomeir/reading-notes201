# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

●● Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs

●● Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms.

**CSS** allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.

Using Internal CSS  <style>

**Why use External**
Style Sheets? When building a website there are several advantages to placing your CSS rules in a separate style sheet.

**How Css Rules Cascade**
If there are two or more rules that apply to the same element, it is important to understand which will take precedence.

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.


**WHAT IS A VARIABLE?**
A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.
